As the user swipes left or right on the memes, their feed will be further fine-tuned using AI to predict content that the user will find funny. Who needs to painstakingly scroll through Reddit, Ifunny or Facebook to find communities that may or may not share your sense of humor when you can have those niche memes come right to you! </p> <!-- Text above buttons -->
